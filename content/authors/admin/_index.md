Hey there, I’m Cedric! I’m an NTU Business undergraduate who’s passionate about UX design, SEO and product management. My journey started when I was doing a digital app mock-up for a university project in October 2021. Currently, I am volunteering as Head of Marketing at Skills for Good, a youth-led ground-up initiative that matches skilled volunteers to meaningful projects with social organisations.
